# National Parks Project

<!-- NOTES, NEED TO EXPAND ON LATER  -->

## Initial Strategy for Project






## Roadblocks 


Find API for data, and getting data to show in mongo




## If More Time Permitted
Would have created favorites page, and given user opportunity to add certain parks to their favorites list. These would have only been available if user logs in

Incorporate Google maps API
